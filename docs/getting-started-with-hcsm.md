# Getting Started with HCSM

Getting Started with HCSM

The below sections will enable the user to get the cloud resources
ordered and manage them efficiently. The sections will also have
respective latest screenshots for each feature from the application to
give the user more realistic feel of the application with examples where
needed. The idea is to keep the content and the screens updated and kept
in sync with the ongoing changes in the HCSM application.
